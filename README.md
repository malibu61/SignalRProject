🚀 Hello everyone!

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed the “ASP.NET Core Booking Management System With API & SignalR QR Code" course by Murat Yücedağ on Udemy, offered by MY YAZILIM EĞİTİM AKADEMİ DANIŞMANLIK. This hands-on training focused on building a real-time ordering system using modern technologies like SignalR and QR Code integrations. 🧾

💡 Project Highlights:

I built a real-time food ordering and booking system. It supports dynamic menu display, table-based order tracking, and live updates through SignalR. The project also includes booking validation, API-layered architecture, and AutoMapper-based DTO management.

🧰 Technologies & Tools Used:

📡 ASP.NET Core Web API (6.0)
🔄 SignalR for real-time communication
📱 QR Code integration
✅ FluentValidation for backend validation
🔀 AutoMapper for DTO mapping
🧱 Layered Architecture (API & Web UI)
🔐 Authentication & Authorization
🔃 AJAX for dynamic UI updates
🧯 SQL Server Trigger for stock management
📋 Booking & Order Management Modules
